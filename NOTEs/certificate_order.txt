7.4.2. Server Certificate

  certificate_list

  This is a sequence (chain) of X.509v3 certificates. The sender's
  certificate must come first in the list. Each following
  certificate must directly certify the one preceding it. Because
  certificate validation requires that root keys be distributed
  independently, the self-signed certificate that specifies the root
  certificate authority may optionally be omitted from the chain,
  under the assumption that the remote end must already possess it
  in order to validate it in any case.
